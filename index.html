<!--
v1.0: initial publish
v1.1.0: fixed a math problem that caused the rows and columns to be reversed.
v1.1.1: previous fixes didn't quite work, so I fixed it using a more concrete method.
v1.1.2: ok I think I finally fixed it
v1.1.3: ugh.
v1.1.4: testing a new solution?
v1.1.5: if this doesn't work, so help me
v1.1.6: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
v1.2.0: instead of fixing the problem, I'm going to make a whole new problem and hope it cancels out the old one (I'm randomizing row/column count) every roll. Later on I'll probably have it do that on pressing space.
v1.2.1: it now also says how many dice there are.
v1.2.2: fixed a typo that caused the program not to run
v1.2.3: fixed another one of those
v1.2.4: added a space before the number of dice.
v1.3.0: the dice still overlap sometimes for some reason, but instead of focusing on that, I made it so spacebar randomizes rows and columns.
v1.3.1: made the spacebar thing actually work instead of being stupid
v1.3.2: they still overlap, but I think I found the problem.
v1.3.3: guess who DIDN'T find the problem...
v1.3.4: let's see if I can pinpoint the problem by setting the fill to transparent
v1.3.5: I made it worse. A lot worse. This much worse: https://imgur.com/a/4l9dRw1.
